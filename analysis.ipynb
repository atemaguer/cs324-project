There's been no cheating, no lying that I know of, nothing to have caused things to go wrong. However it still feels like things are going wrong.\\n\\nUntil about a month ago we were having sex every day. We experimented and tried new things. He performed oral sex on me at least twice a week. It was great. So when the sex started getting less frequent, I talked to him about it. At first he told me I was crazy and I was imagining it so I gave it time. After a week or so though nothing changed. I talked to him about it again and this time he blamed it on his depression, poor self image and his leg pain.
